# Citatype Design Baseline

## Intent

- Calm, focused typing experience.
- Minimal layout with subdued visual hierarchy.
- Avoid visual noise; prioritize legibility and flow.

## Theme Overview

- Default screens: light, near-white background.
- Typing screen only: dark, soft-gradient background (Apple Music/Spotify‑like blur).
- Primary accent: Tiffany Blue.
- Secondary palette: soft grays for text, borders, and surfaces.

## Color System

- Primary (Tiffany Blue): used for emphasis and positive action.
- Secondary (Gray): used for text, borders, and subdued UI.
- Define color scales from 50–900 for both primary and secondary.
- Dark typing screen uses white‑leaning text and muted gray labels.

## Typography

- Use OS‑preinstalled system sans‑serif stack:
  - "SF Pro Text", "SF Pro Display", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont,
    "Segoe UI Variable", "Segoe UI", "Roboto", "Noto Sans", "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif
- Base line height: 1.5–1.65 for readability.
- Keep headings understated (no overly large display type).

## Layout & Spacing

- Clean, single-column layout.
- Generous whitespace to reduce cognitive load.
- Use an 8px spacing rhythm (4/8/12/16/24/32...).
- Round corners softly (12–16px).

## Surfaces & Depth

- Prefer flat or subtle depth.
- Shadows should be minimal (soft, low opacity).
- In dark typing view, cards and inputs are translucent with blur to retain depth without heaviness.

## Typing Screen Background

- Dark, calm gradient with Tiffany Blue emphasis.
- Use layered radial gradients + blur to create atmosphere.
- Keep gradients smooth with minimal contrast differences.
- Overlay should be light to avoid crushing shadows.

## Interaction

- Buttons: solid and outline variants.
- Focus states should be visible but soft (ring with primary/secondary tint).
- Hover states should be subtle, not flashy.

## Accessibility

- Maintain sufficient contrast for body text.
- Ensure focus-visible rings are present for keyboard users.
